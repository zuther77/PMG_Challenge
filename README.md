## PMG Graduate Leadership Program - Software Engineering Programming Challenge
Thank you PMG for giving me this opportunity. I used python3 to solve the challenge. I have used standard libraries for all scripts as well as unit testing which come preinstalled with python3



### Usage
- Create fixtures using  - ``` python generatefixtures.py ``` 
- fixtures can also be found in the test folder
- Script usage - ``` python CSV_Combiner.py ./file1.py ./file2.py ./file3.py ```
- Script will generate "combined.csv" in the current working directory
- Make sure file1, file2, file3 are in the same directory as CSV_Combiner.py
- comment line 81 and 91 in CSV_combiner.py if combined csv file is not needed
